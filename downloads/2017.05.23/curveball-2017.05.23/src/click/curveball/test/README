This directory contains unit and regression tests for the Curveball package.


The main Click package provides the 'testie' tool for running unit and
regression tests. To run 'testie', pass it one or more test files, e.g.,

	testie bloomfilter.testie

Alternatively, specify directory names; the directories are recursively
searched for '*.testie' files.

	testie .

Test status will be printed. Error messages are provided for failed tests.

Refer to the 'testie' man page for additional information.


Note that 'flowfilter.testie' will likely fail if run on Mac OS X or any
operating system other than Linux. This is due to the fact that flow keys
are stored within the hash table in a different order.
