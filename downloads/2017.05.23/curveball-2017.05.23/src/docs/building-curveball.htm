    <h2> <a id="Intro">Introduction</a> </h2>

    <p> This document describes how to build the
    version of Raytheon BBN Technologies' BBN Curveball
    specified in the title of this document. </p>

    <p> This document is intended for developers who want to
    extend or modify BBN Curveball in some way.
    (Ordinary users will usually find it more convenient
    to install a pre-built version of BBN Curveball than
    to build their own.) </p>

    <p>
    Note that installing the tools needed to build
    BBN Curveball may require system privileges on many operating systems.
    </p>

    <p>
    This document only describes how to build BBN Curveball for
    Ubuntu 12.04 on the amd64 platform.
    BBN Curveball also supports
    Windows 7, Windows 8, Android, and MacOSX,
    and future releases will contain detailed instructions for
    building for those platforms.
    </p>

    <h2> Getting the BBN Curveball source </h2>

    <p>
    The source for BBN Curveball is available from
    <a href="https://curveball.nct.bbn.com/">curveball.nct.bbn.com</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
    Make sure that the version you download matches
    this document.
    If you choose to download and use a different version of the
    source, then you can follow the directions for
    getting and unpacking the source in this document,
    and then continue with the appropriate instructions
    that were bundled with the version you downloaded.
    </p>

    <p>
    The BBN Curveball source is released as a gzip'd tar file.
    The name of the file will have the form
    <tt>curveball-<i>VERSION</i>.tgz</tt>, where
    <i>VERSION</i> is a string of the form <tt><i>YYYY.MM.DD</i></tt>
    that represents the date of the release.
    In the rest of this document, we will use the string
    VERSION to represent the date of the release.
    </p>

    <p>
    In order to open it, you need to have a version of <tt>tar</tt> that
    is able to decompress the gzip format, or you will need to have
    a version of gzip.
    These tools are included by default on Linux and MacOSX,
    but on Windows it may be necessary to download a third-party tool.
    We recommend <tt>mingw</tt>, for building on Windows 7.
    </p>

    <h2> <a id="Linux-u1204">Linux - Ubuntu 12.04 (amd64)</a> </h2>

    <p>
    Curveball has been primarily developed and tested on Ubuntu 12.04 on
    the <tt>amd64</tt> architecture.
    It has also been built and tested successfully on the <tt>i386</tt>
    architecture.
    It has not been tested on architectures with different endianess. </p>

    <b>NOTE: for this version of BBN Curveball,
    it is generally a good idea to build on a virtual machine
    or dedicated host</b>
    because the build procedure may download and install or update any
    packages that are required by the build process or by BBN Curveball.
    Also note that the build procedure may also install BBN Curveball
    software on the build machine, and may alter configuration files.
    <b>Building BBN Curveball may modify the configuration of the build
      machine, even if BBN Curveball is not installed.</b>
    This will be fixed in a future release.
    </p>

    <p>
    After downloading the release tarball with the desired <i>VERSION</i>,
    and placing it in working direction:
    </p>

    <pre>
    tar zxf curveball-<i>VERSION</i>.tgz
    cd curveball-<i>VERSION</i>/src
    make debfile
    </pre>

    <p>
    This will create a Debian package file for the current architecture,
    with a name with the prefix <tt>curveball-<i>VERSION</i></tt>,
    in the directory <tt>curveball-<i>VERSION</i>/src</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
    <b>Note:</b> during the build of the BBN Curveball <tt>click</tt> elements,
    you may see messages like the following:
    </p>

    <pre>
    ...
    CXX decodertest.cc
    /bin/bash: decodertest.d: No such file or directory
    CXX dr2dpdecoder.cc
    /bin/bash: dr2dpdecoder.d: No such file or directory
    CXX dr2dpdecodertest.cc
    /bin/bash: dr2dpdecodertest.d: No such file or directory
    ...
    </pre>

    <p>
    These messages are harmless and do not indicate that the build
    has failed.
    </p>

    <h3> Notes </h3>

    <p>
    There are no prerequisites that need to be installed or configured
    before building BBN Curveball on Ubuntu 12.04.
    The build procedure will download and install any packages that
    are required by the build process and are not already installed.
    Note that this requires network access and <tt>sudo</tt>.
    </p>

    <p>
    In addition to creating the Debian package,
    the Curveball scripts, executables, and other files
    are copied to <tt>curveball-<i>VERSION</i>/build</tt>.
    </p>
