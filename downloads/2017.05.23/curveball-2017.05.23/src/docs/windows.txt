WINDOWS BUILD GUIDE - version 2017.05.23 

This document describes how to build an installer for the
BBN Curveball client on Windows 7.

These instructions have been tested on Windows 7 Professional 64-bit.

PREREQUISITES:

1.  Install Visual Studio C++ Express 2008

    This is available from http://go.microsoft.com/?linkid=7729279

    Note that some of the third-party packages used by BBN Curveball
    are not believed to compile correctly with later versions of
    VSC++, so we strongly recommend using the 2008 version.

2.  Download Python 2.7 from http://www.python.org/download, and
    install it as C:\Python27

    Use all the default installation settings.

    DO NOT use the X86-64 installer -- use the 32-bit installer for
    Windows.  Even if you are running the 64-bit version of Windows,
    install the 32-bit version of Python and the other libraries and
    related applications.  If you end up with mix of 32- and 64-bit
    libraries, the system will not run properly, due to bugs in some
    of the third-party code.  This is the most likely cause of the
    error if you see a message like:

    "ImportError: DLL load failed: X is not a valid Win32 application"

3.  Add C:\Python27\ and C:\Python27\scripts to your path
    in your command shell.

4.  Install a recent version of pywin32 for 32-bit Python.

    This is available from:

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32

5.  Install the Python "easy installer" setup tools:

    Download:
    
    https://bitbucket.org/pypa/setuptools/raw/bootstrap/ez_setup.py

    and run the file in a new command shell.  This command will
    download and install the rest of the "easy installer" utilities.

6.  Install the packages necessary to run curveball-client:

    easy_install ipaddr
    easy_install PySide
    pyside_postinstall.py -install
    easy_install zope.interface
    easy_install twisted

7.  Install M2Crypto:

    There was a pre-built M2Crypto-0.21.1.win32-py2.7.exe at the
    Chandler Project (http://chandlerproject.org/Projects/MeTooCrypto)
    but it appears to be offline, and it is likely that this installer
    includes a version of OpenSSL that still had the Heartbleed
    vulnerability.

    We recommend downloading the most recent version of M2Crypto
    and its dependencies, building them yourself, and installing
    M2Crypto in C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\.  Make sure to
    build them for Python2.7 and win32.

8.  Add the M2Crypto and Pyside tools to your path:

    C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\M2Crypto
    C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages\PySide-1.2.1-py2.7-win32.egg\PySide

9.  Install the Mozilla BuildTools from

    http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/mozilla/libraries/win32/MozillaBuildSetup-Latest.exe

10.  Download and install cx-freeze from

    http://sourceforge.net/projects/cx-freeze/files/4.3.1/cx_Freeze-4.3.1.win32-py2.7.msi/download

BUILDING

1.  At the command prompt, with your path set as described
    in the prerequisites, start the mozilla build environment:

    C:\mozilla-build\start-msvc9

2. cd to the BBN Curveball src/ directory and build:

    cd <PATH-TO-CURVEBALL-SOURCE>
    make -f client-win.mk build-msi

    This will create a file with a name like
    "CurveballClient-2014.12.03-win32.msi"
    in directory packaging/dist/.

SETUP AND RUNNING IN VPN MODE ON WINDOWS

 * * * NOTE - VPN MODE IS BROKEN ON WINDOWS * * *

VPN mode is not working on Windows and we have not been able to debug the issues
prior to this release.  This section describes the steps needed to get the VPN
into an "almost working" mode, and what the issues appear to be.


1. Setup for the VPN

    In order to run in VPN mode, a TUN/TAP device must be installed.  BBN
    Curveball has been tested with the implementation from OpenVPN.  To
    install, download tap-windows-latest-stable.exe from
    http://build.openvpn.net/downloads/releases/latest/

    After installing the TAP device, find the device (open the windows search,
    type 'view network connections', click on the matching choice). It should
    be the one on the right, with a name like 'TAP-Win32 Adapter'. Double click
    on it to open the "Properties" dialog. Double click on the 'Internet
    Protocol Version 4' row.  A dialog box will appear. Click on the "Use the
    following DNS server addresses" button, if it is not already enabled, and
    then enter the DNS server you wish to use.  (The Google public DNS server
    at '8.8.8.8' will work if you can reach the Internet.)  Press the 'OK'
    button at the button of the dialog to return to the TAP configuration
    dialog.  Uncheck the box next to IPv6 to disable IPv6 support on this
    device, and then click the 'OK' on the parent dialog.


2. Running the VPN

    VPN mode requires elevated privileges; instead of running curveball-client
    from an ordinary shell, create a shell by right-clicking on its icon and
    selecting "Run as administrator".

    NOTE: the default VPN subnet used by curveball-client causes an crash
    on Windows because it is incompletely specified.  (This is not generally
    a problem because the default is almost always overridden.)  Make sure
    to use a full 32-bit subnet address (i.e. 10.0.0.0/8, instead of 10/8).


3. Issues

    The "route add" command does not correctly add the routes through the tun
    device.  It appears that in the current version of the tun driver (or
    perhaps Windows 7) the address of the tun device cannot be used as a
    gateway.
