EDITED FILES:

coreconf/Darwin.mk - 2013-05-21
    Updated to be build on more recent versions of Darwin/MacOSX (10.8)

nss/cmd/Makefile - 2013-05-21

    Updated to be build on more recent versions of Darwin/MacOSX (10.8)

nss/Makefile - 2012-08-30

    Added rules for building etags and xref files to simplify code browsing

nss/cmd/digest/digest.c - 2012-08-30

    Added comments.  Most changes were unintentional reformatting.

nss/lib/freebl/ldvector.c - 2014-04-04

    Added BBN Curveball functions to the ldvector array.

nss/lib/freebl/loader.c, nss/lib/freebl/loader.h - 2014-04-28

    Added stub functions for BBN Curveball functions to the loader.

nss/lib/freebl/manifest.mn - 2014-04-03

    Added curveball_rijndael.c and curveball_rijndael.h to the manifest.

nss/lib/freebl/rijndael.c - 2014-04-04

    Add diagnostics and calls to the curveball_rijndael functions.

Edited: nss/lib/manifest.mn - 2014-04-01

    Add "curveball" to the list of directories to build, and reorder the
    list of directories so that "base" is built first.

nss/lib/softoken/pkcs11c.c - 2013-05-06

    Modify how the SSL PremasterSecret is chosen to use the Curveball protocol
    if the connection is using the Curveball protocol.

nss/lib/softoken/rsawrapr.c - 2013-09-24

    If using Curveball, then when encrypting the SSL PremasterSecret (or
    anything else that is exactly the same length) then do not use random
    padding.  Use a deterministic pad, according to the Curveball protocol.

nss/lib/ssl/config.mk - 2012-05-31

    Add dependency on nssb, which is needed by Curveball functions.

nss/lib/ssl/manifest.mn - 2014-04-03

    Added the curveball header files to EXPORTS, and the Curveball C source
    files to CSRCS.  Also added sslimpl.h and ssl3prot.h to EXPORTS, because
    these are referenced by files in other libraries.

nss/lib/ssl/ssl.def - 2013-04-13

    Added Curveball global variables.

nss/lib/ssl/ssl3con.c - 2014-06-07

    Implement the BBN Curveball protocol.

    For testing purposes, limit the ciphersuites to those that the BBN
    Curveball implementation currently supports.

nss/lib/ssl/ssl3ecc.c - 2013-09-27

    Handle the case where most ciphersuites are disabled (see
    nss/lib/ssl/ssl3con.c).

nss/lib/ssl/sslimpl.h - 2014-06-07

    Add Curveball fields to ssl3StateStr; add declarations for Curveball
    functions.

nss/lib/ssl/sslsecur.c - 2014-04-04

    Clear Curveball flags on the socket, if any.  The presence of Curveball
    flags on an open socket, after the handshake, causes some non-Curveball
    functions to break because these functions don't know how to interpret
    these flags.

nss/lib/ssl/sslsock.c - 2012-06-08

    Initialize the Curveball fields in each new sslsock.

nss/lib/util/secerr.h - 2012-05-31

    Add error code for Curveball errors.
