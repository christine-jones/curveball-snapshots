1. Delete files that are created/modified by autogen/configure script

src/transmission/Makefile.in
src/transmission/aclocal.m4
src/transmission/cli/Makefile.in
src/transmission/config.guess
src/transmission/config.sub
src/transmission/configure
src/transmission/daemon/Makefile.in
src/transmission/depcomp
src/transmission/extras/Makefile.in
src/transmission/gtk/Makefile.in
src/transmission/gtk/icons/Makefile.in
src/transmission/libtransmission/Makefile.in
src/transmission/libtransmission/version.h
src/transmission/ltmain.sh
src/transmission/m4/libtool.m4
src/transmission/macosx/Makefile.in
src/transmission/third-party/Makefile.in
src/transmission/third-party/dht/Makefile.in
src/transmission/third-party/libnatpmp/Makefile.in
src/transmission/third-party/libutp/Makefile.in
src/transmission/third-party/miniupnp/Makefile.in

src/transmission/web/style/transmission/Makefile.in
src/transmission/web/style/transmission/images/Makefile.in
src/transmission/web/style/transmission/images/buttons/Makefile.in

2. Make 6881 the default bittorrent peer-port

src/transmission/cli/transmission-cli.1
src/transmission/daemon/transmission-daemon.1
src/transmission/libtransmission/transmission.h
src/transmission/macosx/Defaults.plist

3. Embed encryption input into transmission handshake

   ff --ei option is passed using the transmission CL input.
   --ei option requires encryption just like --er.

   Add #ifdef preprocessor for ENCRYPTION_INPUT option
    
   There are some debug "printf"s, which may be pruned
   later or not, since not passing "--log-debug" option
   to transmission-daemon will turn off all "printf"s.
    
   The --ei option support for transmission-remote is
   included as well.

src/transmission/daemon/daemon.c
src/transmission/daemon/transmission-daemon.1
src/transmission/daemon/remote.c
src/transmission/libtransmission/crypto-test.c
src/transmission/libtransmission/crypto.c
src/transmission/libtransmission/crypto.h
src/transmission/libtransmission/handshake.c
src/transmission/libtransmission/quark.c
src/transmission/libtransmission/quark.h
src/transmission/libtransmission/rpc-test.c
src/transmission/libtransmission/rpcimpl.c
src/transmission/libtransmission/session.c
src/transmission/libtransmission/session.h
src/transmission/libtransmission/transmission.h

4. Enable option to feed key input via transmission-daemon (command line).

src/transmission/daemon/daemon.c
src/transmission/daemon/remote.c
src/transmission/daemon/transmission-daemon.1
src/transmission/daemon/transmission-remote.1
src/transmission/libtransmission/handshake.c
src/transmission/libtransmission/quark.c
src/transmission/libtransmission/quark.h
src/transmission/libtransmission/rpc-test.c
src/transmission/libtransmission/rpcimpl.c
src/transmission/libtransmission/session.c
src/transmission/libtransmission/session.h
src/transmission/libtransmission/transmission.h

5. Add check that when encryption input is not NULL, ensure
   that the length is 2 * KEY_LEN (=192).
 
   Check if the encryption-input is all hex-str.

src/transmission/libtransmission/crypto.c
src/transmission/libtransmission/handshake.c

6. Add InfoHash in the last 20 bytes of PadA

   Iff the len(PadA) is greater than len(InfoHash).

src/transmission/libtransmission/handshake.c

7. README on how to build/install transmission with changes we made.

    It details how to install dependencies (assuming one has
    access to a canonical repo or the Internet). Then it
    describes how to configure transmission with the changes
    we made, and finally tells you how to build/install
    transmission from checked-in 2.84 transmission src.
