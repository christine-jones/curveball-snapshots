master.km is the master file for the key management and revocation.

master.km.orig is a backup copy of the original master.km file.

These files are initially populated with keys used for debugging
and testing.  THE "test*" KEYS ARE NOT A SECRET AND SHOULD NEVER
BE USED ON THE OPEN INTERNET.

keys_short is provided for historical reasons.  It should be
regenerated, using cbnoc-keymanager, from the master file.
